# UX Project - Terminal Eats

### Starving, in line at security, and cutting it close to departure? Terminal Eats will help you find your favorite restaurant in your terminal, show you estimated wait times, and even let you place an order so it is waiting for you. Now you can board your plane with that delicious meatball sub just waiting to be eaten. Your tummy--and your fellow passengers--will thank you!!!

*Terminal Eats is an independent project, an opportunity for me to apply lessons from tutorials and an excuse to just try things out!*

## Workflow Spec

Tools: Graph paper, pencil

Takeaways: Drawing the workflow diagram forces decisions about the app's functionality and making sure they support the app's goals.

## Wireframes

Tools: iPhone 10 templates, pencil, eraser

Takeaways: The wireframe brings life to the workflow diagram. Creative thinking is required to accommodate the functional demands while keeping the interface attractive and intuitive.

## Mockup (Canva)

Tools: Canva, ctrl+c, ctrl+v (repeat)

Takeaways: Canva is limited for working across multiple artboards, as changes do not propagate through the design. I (later) found using symbols in Sketch to be more flexible and efficient.

## Prototype Planning

Tools: Marvel

Takeaways: Reviewing the hotspot map is a great opportunity to compare the mockups with the workflow diagram to make sure the app will function as planned.

## Prototype (Marvel)

Tools: Marvel

Takeaways: Sometimes despite sweat and tears a project just doesn't work out. But I learned so much in the effort, and looking back on this project, seeing how far I've come, is a great morale booster.

## Mockup using Sketch (Sketch)

Tools: Sketch

Takeaways: Symbols and libraries are amazing. My Sketch course emphasized efficiencies like properly using symbols and (many) keyboard shortcuts.

## Final Prototype (Invision)

Tools: Invision, Sketch

Takeaways: Managing file structures and naming conventions is essential for working on imported Sketch files in Invision, something I will account for in future project planning.

Other takeaway: Know when to move on. Nothing is ever perfect, never done. My list of improvements is long and I could work on this app forever, but my idea for a CSPAN app (yes, really) is calling to meâ€¦ and it's time to learn Adobe XD.
