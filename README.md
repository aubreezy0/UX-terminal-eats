# UX Project - Terminal Eats

<div style="font-size:18px">
<p>Starving, in line at security, and cutting it close to departure? Terminal Eats helps you find restaurants in your terminal, check prep times, and place an order for pickup, so you can board your flight hot meatball sub in hand!</p>

<div style="font-size:14px">
<p style="color:green">Terminal Eats is an independent project (not based on a tutorial). It is an opportunity for me to apply lessons in UX tools, and an excuse to just try things out!</p>

Tools: Invision, Sketch, Atom, Marvel, Canva, Pencil, Paper, and Persistence

Takeaway: Damn, I love this stuff!

## Prep and Planning
<details>
<summary style="font-size:24px">Workflow Spec</summary>
<div style="font-size:18px">
<p>Tools: Graph paper, pencil</p>

Takeaways: Drawing the workflow diagram forces decisions about the app's functionality and making sure they support the app's goals.

<summary style="font-size:24px">Wireframes</summary>
<div style="font-size:18px">
<p>Tools: iPhone 10 templates, pencil, eraser</p>

Takeaways: The wireframe brings life to the workflow diagram. Creative thinking is required to accommodate the functional demands while keeping the interface attractive and intuitive.

<details>
<summary style="font-size:24px">Mockup (Canva)</summary>
<div style="font-size:18px">
<p>Tools: Canva, ctrl+c, ctrl+v (repeat)</p>

Takeaways: Canva is limited for working across multiple artboards, as changes do not propagate through the design. I (later) found using symbols in Sketch to be more flexible and efficient.

## Prototypes

<details>
<summary style="font-size:24px">Prototype v.1</summary>
<div style="font-size:18px">
<p>Tools: Marvel</p>

Takeaways: Reviewing the hotspot map is a great opportunity to compare the mockups with the workflow diagram to make sure the app will function as planned.

<details>
<summary style="font-size:24px">Prototype v.2 (Marvel)</summary>
<div style="font-size:18px">
<p>Tools: Marvel</p>

Takeaways: Sometimes despite sweat and tears a project just doesn't work out. But I learned so much in the effort, and looking back on this project, seeing how far I've come, is a great morale booster.

<details>
<summary style="font-size:24px">Prototype Mockup (Sketch)</summary>
<div style="font-size:18px">
<p>Tools: Sketch</p>

Takeaways: Symbols and libraries are amazing. My Sketch course emphasized efficiencies like properly using symbols and (many) keyboard shortcuts.

<summary style="font-size:24px">Final Prototype</summary>
<div style="font-size:18px">
<p>Tools: Invision</p>

<p>Takeaways: Managing file structures and naming conventions is essential for working on imported Sketch files in Invision, something I will account for in future project planning.</p>

<p>Other takeaway: <span style="color:green">It's time to move on.</span> Nothing is ever perfect, never done. What's important is to recognize when something more important has come along. I really could work on this app forever, but my idea for a CSPAN app (yes, really) is calling to meâ€¦ and it's time to learn Adobe XD.</p>
