# UX Project - Terminal Eats

### Starving, in line at security, and cutting it close to departure? Terminal Eats will help you find your favorite restaurant in your terminal, show you estimated wait times, and even let you place an order so it is waiting for you. Now you can board your plane with that delicious meatball sub just waiting to be eaten. Your tummy--and your fellow passengers--will thank you!!!

*Please note this is an independent project to demonstrate where I am in the learning process. This is* **not** *a tutorial step-by-step. Thank you!*

## tl;dr

They say (and it's true) that in UX you are your own worst client. None-the-less, I saw a problem, suffered greatly, and adopted it as the guiding inspiration for this independent project. I spend every second in the security line hangrily fretting about getting food before I get on the plane. This "GrubHub pickup for airports" would get me to my plane, PotBelly Italian grinder seeping oil in my bag, ready to sit in the middle seat in the last row of the plane. Messy. Yummy. How is this not already a thing?

## Workflow Spec

The workflow map was my first indicator that what at first seemed like a "simple" app, had a lot going on. In the workflow, the decision points are supposed to be diamonds, but that got awkward with angling my template, so I got fancy with a different symbol.

## Wireframes (Round 1)
These (very early) sketched wireframes provided the basis for the first prototype I developed. The process gave me an early glimpse into the level of planning needed for designing UX work.

## Mockup (Round 1)
The first mockups for Terminal Eats were built using a free tool, Canva. My frustrations with repeatedly copy/pasting assets would later be addressed using symbols on Sketch.

The mockup, with few exceptions, is simply black and white. I learned this strategy in my <!-- add class name and details -->class in app design. Leaving color to a later stage minimizes distractions during the design process.

## Prototype Planning (Round 1)

Using Marvel I created the first clickable  prototype. I was was more complex than expected. I mapped out the hotspots for the app.

## Prototype (Round 1)

My first complete prototype was... rough. But I learned a lot along the way. Although I moved on to InVision, the Marvel web app gave me a good introduction to prototyping. By downloading the Terminal Eats app to my phone I was able to see where there were problems with the workflow, many of which I addressed in later version. Holding the app in my hand did one other thing--it connected me with the product of my work, and with the responsibilty I have to do this right because... someday people might actually *use* this thing, just as I was in that moment.

*Caveat*
I don't actually recommend this clickthrough prototype. I've come a long way and, although it shows my very humble beginnings, it can very very frustrating. The only working restaurant is Quizzy's, and only the Italian and Meatball subs...

## Mockup using Sketch (Round 2)
I took an amazing course to learn Sketch. During the tutorial all of the files were provided, but I could not wait to apply what I learned in Sketch to my Terminal Eats project. I was left with MANY questions (especially about capitalizing properly on symbols). I will add more on that in issues. Very excited with the final product here, and looking forward to bringing it to life in InVision!

## Final Prototype

This is a love story that ends in despair, but with hope for new life and new opportunities ahead. I couldn't wait to dive into InVision, but I found it kludgy, to say the least. It was important to learn its quirks, but halfway though I saw a demo that made me want to learn XD, which I will do for my next project. Though my list of v3 changes is long, I am proud of this release, and to conclude my first solo UX project, Terminal Eats.

Hop straight to "Find Food." You are dying for Ahi Tuna from Oh So Sushi, and can check out the map, too!
